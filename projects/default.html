		<div id="text">
			<p1>My passion for web development and design began not long ago. I was browsing youtube and I came across a channel with tons of tutorials for all different languages. I delved right in watching hours and hours of videos and I realized something. This is fun.</p1><br><br>
			<p1>Typing in a text editor and watching it appear on a webpage gives me an amazing feeling. After one week I have a feel for HTML and CSS. I've started to learn Javascript and JQuerey but those are much more challenging.</p1><br><br>
			<p1> I'm currently enrolled in business courses at college, but next semester I plan on switching to Computer Science.</p1></div>

		<div class="column2">
			<p1>Some of my other interests include going to the beach, spending time with my girlfriend and her family, and occasionly staying up late playing Overwatch.</p1><br><br> 
			<p1>I currently work as a Purchasing Assistant for an Ecommerce company. I work with vendors, freight and logistics companies, and Amazon Fullfilment centers.</p1><br><br>
